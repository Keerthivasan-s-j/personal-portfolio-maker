            <h2 class="mt-5">About the Developer</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm <strong>Keerthivasan S J</strong>, the developer behind this project. I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for web development and Python programming. 
                I created this project to simplify personal branding for students, developers, and professionals who want to present their work beautifully online without having to write code.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project is built using <strong>Django</strong> for the backend, with support for features like template inheritance, static file handling, and dynamic profile rendering. 
                I'm continuously working to improve the project with future features like drag-and-drop content arrangement and theme customization.
            </p>
